# App

The app is built using Blazor Web component framework, and it targets many platforms.

It can either be run as a Mobile app, using .NET MAUI, or as a standard Web app in a browser. 

Platform-specific code has been abstracted from the app project-

The parts that make up the actual app are in the Catalog project/folder. These are shared by app projects.
